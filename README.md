# Tempestuous Turrets

Tempestuous Turrets is a 4 player local-multiplayer game created using Unity that myself and two of my friends made in under 32 hours for [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com) 2022!

You can also [download it for windows](https://owengretz.itch.io/tempestuous-turrets), [try it on the web](http://tempestuousturrets.tech/) (laggier than windows version), and [see the Devpost Page](https://devpost.com/software/tempestuous-turrets).
